### Chapter 8 Trend(Momentum) Trading Strategies
- Enter close to support to minimize risk, and give high reward i.e. near a respected SMA, or bottom of a flag/pullback
- As a momentun trader, buy stocks that already made a big move. It's common for stock under $10 to make 50% move during the day
- Usually buy and sell at the Ask Price.
- Once target price is hit, take some profit and move stop loss to break even
- It's important to keep a little on the stock until we see an exit indicator
- Float is also a factor to consider when trading, low float stocks are volatile, shares under 5mil are considered as low float, and stocks under 1mil are usually the best runners
- Each day premarket, generate a list of 4-6 stocks to trade
- Using scanner, scan for new stocks that are hitting high of day with abover average volume
- Every time a momentum stock makes a breakout, trade the breakout or the first, second pullback.
- Is riskier to trade beyond the second pullback unless going through a period of consolidation.
- For stocks with extreme strength, only go in with a small position due to risk.
- Pullbacks respecting the 9 ema are stronger

* Facts that determine how quick the price moves: *
- Daily resistance
- catalyst
- level of volume
- float can determine how fast prices move

#### Flattop
- Flattop is a pattern in which the stock did no have time to pull back to 9ema since it's too strong. It consilidates side ways making higher lows without making lower highs. The set up would be stronger if it consolidates at whole/half dollars
- During the consolidation, check for windows and triggers near price point
- Apex point is the point at the highest of a flattop, when volume is high, with a strong strength in Sales and Time, that's the entry buying point with half position size with a stop loss at bottom of wedge
- If it does not break out, hold and wait for it to break support
- If it breaks support and falls back down below the breakout price, then sell
- Typically requires a stock to move up very strong for a few hours(4hr+)
 
#### Bullflags
- A BullFlag has a stronger pullback compared to a flattop
- Can be detected by high of day scanner, when price surges with high relative volume
- Buy when first candle makes a new high in the body of the flag
- Best bullflags make less than 25% pullbacks
- Stop loss at low of the pullback
- First profit target at high of day
- Don't enter the trade at high of the day
- Double tops are strong resistance points
- An important trait when volume is greater surging than it is pulling back
- High volume in the pullback may indicate reversal
- Would be good to see it above 9/20 ema on a 5m chart
- Use 5m chart since it'd

#### parabolic
- A Parabolic stock is the one that goes up/down with a very strong strength for a very long time due to strong catalyst/chart
- We can mitigate the risk starting with a smaller position as cusion and add position size as the stock goes up 
- Wait for the stock to reverse and trade counter setup
- Start with 1/4 position size since risk is much greater

#### Gap and Go
- A momentum stock that shows a gap premarket
- These stocks will generally make a big move when market opens due to volatility 
- Works best with stocks under $20
- Need to have good volume premarket to confirm market movement
- Need 4% move with 50K volume premarket
- Don't trade gap and go with strong pullbacks, i.e. up 30% then drop 20%
- Need to have hotkeys

* Entry requirements for Momentum and Gap & Go: *
- 100k in volume first minute market opens
- 1mil in volume
- Achieve 1:2 profit loss ratio
- High relative volume of >2
- Most have a obvious pattern
- Idealy close to 9/20 ema
- Ideally, float should be <50mil. <10 has the highest potential. Unless using vwap based method
- Good catalyst
- Good window and trigger
- Tight spread(For momentum trades)

* 1m Entries: *
- Very high volume s.t. 5 min candles are too volatile for risk management
- Entry price at apex
- start with half size, double up if we can adjust stop loss to break even

* 5m Entries: *
- Can start with bigger position
- Buy at apex point
- During midday, since volume is much lighter
- Used for momentum trades afteÂ¡r 10am, set stop loss at low of pullback just below 9ema or ascending support line

* Exit indicators: *
- 5m candle with lower low before scaling out
- Breaks 9ema on 5m
- Adjust stop to break even or get stopped out

* Profit Target: *
- When approaching a resistance, take partial profit and adjust stop loss to break even

* Gap & Go - Flattop/bullflag *
- Best gap and go shows flattop and bullflag pattern premarket
- Look at the lvl2, jump in once almost all the ask shares are bought out
- If we see heavy volume at market open, it validates the breakout point

* Gap & Go - Open range breakout *
- If gap and go opens inbetween resistance/suppor levels
- Buy first 1m making a new high, set the stop loss at low of the candle, if the 1m candle does not break, switch to 5min ORB
- Take profit on the first surge, and update stop loss to break even

* Gap & Go - First pullback *
- Must be one of bullflag/flattop or 9ema

* Gap & Go - Red to Green *
- When price drops below opening price in premarket + market open and surges back to the opening price in premarket
- On first candle making a new high after a washout, set stop loss at low of day, sell half the position as soon as it hits desired price and adjust the stop loss to breakeven

## Chapter 9 Counter Trend(Reversal)
- Profit risk ratio is usually higher, but can be riskier. i.e. 1:3 ratio
- Higher volume on the reversal candle
- At least 500k volume on the day
- If a whole sector is experiencing strong trend, we can pick a few stocks in the same sector
- Start with a quarter/half the position size
- Put a stop loss of 20 cents or low/high of day
- If we can get a daily chart confirmation, it would be stronger
- May reaction to MovAvg confirmation sometimes
- Tight spread(For momentum trades)
- Can buy the pullbacks on 1m/5m chart for a low risk trade

* Entry Requirement: *
- 3+ consecutive green candles
- Candles riding on or out side of bollinger band
- Stock at high/low of the day
- RSI < 20 or > 80
- Need to take note of the float
- Ideally the reversal candle should be a doji, shooting star or a hammer
- Ideally at daily res/sup
- Idealy the over all market supports the decision
- 2:1 ratio at least
- At least 30 cents to the 9ema

* Exit indicators: *
- High/Low of the day
- Sell half when touch 9ema on 5m chart, or when hit 2:1 profit ratio. Then adjust stop to break even.
- When price breaks 9ema or the vwap, adjust stop loss to the other side of the indicator and every 5mins onwards
		- 
* Reversal - 1m entry: *
- Need to see 10 consecutive candles
- If it becomes profitable, and gets 5m confirmation, double up to full size
- If there's resistance, take partial profit
- Sometimes may buy at whole/half dollars if there's price reaction

* Reversal - 5m entry: *
- When there's 5 min candle outside of bollinger, use bottom of candle as stop loss top as entry point or double up point
- If already started with half position, double up and adjust stop to break even/-10 cents
- Check 1m chart to ensure it's not too extended, i.e. 5 consecutive candles



### Chapter 1 why most Traders fail:

- Need to keep winners longer, sell losers faster
- Excercise before day begins to relieve mental stress and keep head clearer
- Be cautious of FOMO(fear of missin out)
- Stay displine and keep emotion out of the trade

### Chapter 2 Risk Management:

- Stop loss should be based on recent support or resistance area
- Should be within max dollar loss amount
- A stock will halt for 5 min if it falls for 10% within 5 min
- Limit position on stocks that can be halted
- Need to plan out entry and exit before entering a trade
- At least 1:2 profit loss risk ratio

* Keep historical data of(Analyse based on the strategy, the profits or losses, or the time of day): *
- type of setup
- time
- symbol
- price
- entry
- exit
- amount made/amount lost
- notes

- Set a per-trade loss and a daily loss. Set to 25% of target profit.
- Shouldn't have 1 trade that weights more than many trades combined.
- Can adjust risk based on time of day

### Chapter 3 Stock Selection:
- Short Sell Restriction(SSR) - Stocks can not be short sell if it dropped for more than 10% in a day.
- Retail trader are attracted to news, and sometimes extreme highs/lows
- Stocks in play with high volume & high relative volume, and with low float.

* Multiday Momentum *
- Stocks with high momentum can carry over to the next day
- Stay away from insider days(highs and lows within previous day's range)
- Trade when the stock price makes a fresh breakout from previous high

### Chapter 4 Candlesticks:
- Use 1m, 5m, daily chart. We use daily charts even for intraday trade see daily support/resistance.
- A doji following a series of same colored candlesticks can indicate indicision/reversal
- A strong uptrend following a hammer with a very long top wick can signal a potential reversal
- A strong downtrend following a shooting star with a long bottom wick can signal a potential reversal
- Want to hold for a long green candle, not after a long green candle

### Chapter 5 Setting up the Chart:
- 1m, 5m, daily chart
- 9, 20, 50, 200 EMA, vwap
- With a chart respecting the 9ema, each pullback near the 9ema is a buying opportunity, price going below ema shows a chance to change direction
- Trend reversal - When chart is trading below the 9/20ema, and 9/20 crosses with candle trading above the 9/20 ema from that point on
- Stocks respecting 9ema has more strength than 20ema
- Stocks around 200ema may take longer to consolidate
- Trade long on stocks above 200ema
- Use vwap for trend based trading
- For a counter trend setup, find a entry point far from the equalibrium(i.e. out side of Bollinger band(5m), use RSI(<20/>80)
- Volume is used to see how momentum grows and fades. In a consilidation, high volumn may mean a potential breakout

### Chapter 6 Support & Resistance:
- 3-6 mth daily chart can be useful to find recent sup/res
- Volumn can confirm a breakout pattern, and how substainable it is
- For daily res/sup, that level is only valid in that day if it's not broken
- Sup/Res can also be ascending/descending
- When a stock has a big gap in between the next sup/res, then the stock has breakout potential and it's worth watching
- A triger is a sup/res with a large window of no resistance above
- For example, if a stock has ATR of 50 cents, and the next resistance leve is 75 cents above the price, then this is a trigger
- When a stock has a big gap, there's a large window in the stock that will typically get filled. It can be formed in the past d/m/y
- Whole and half dollars can act as sup/res, or can act as consolidation areas, especially for high volume stocks and intraday extremes
- Trade in direction of the gap, a stock gapping up should be moving away from the MovAvg's, in the contrary a stock that gapped down should be moving below the MovAvg's
- MovAvgs are some of the most significant form of sup/res
- If price is respecting 9ema and suddently stopped, then it indicates a break of pattern and potentially trend reversal

### Chapter 7 Order type, Lvl 2, Time and Sales, Hotkeys
- Use limit order with offset of 5, i.e. buy at $5.00-$5:05
- Some traders use stop limit to buy at the breakout spot
- Use a lvl2 + time/sales window + order entry window for buying
- Look at lvl2 ask + bid window, and ensure there big buyers and small sellers are at price
- Spoofing is when users place large and fake orders to misguide people, they will move down the price when it gets close
- If there's a large seller, wait until they get consumed before going into the trade
- Time and sales can show volume, transactions and number of shares flowing though
- Prepare 4 order windows ready to buy before market opens. Buy and switch to hotkey when there's value at market open.
- Use hotkey for enter, exit, stop and cancel orders
- For Gap and Go, Momentun trades, open order window and enter with mouse click. Once entered in the trade, use hotkeys to optimize profit
- Favorite key: sell half the position at bid/ask price
- Some other hotkeys include set stop at breakeven/average cost, price - 11cent, price - 21 cent, price - 31 cent etc...

## Chapter 10 Stock Scanning and Building a Watchlist

- Trade-Ideas scanner
- By 9AM, build a list of 4-6 stocks in play
- For each of the stocks, jot down what the catalyst, float, key sup/res, and potential entry points
- There's scanners looking for 52 week highs, daily breakouts, massive intraday volume, and extreme rate of change
- It's important to confirm catalyst before entering any trade
- Stocks spike up due to news catalyst usually worth watching for the rest of the day

*Gap Scanner:*
- <-4% or >4%
- price above 1

*Momentum Scanner:*
- $1 - $10
- > 100000 volume
- relative volume of 2
- 5 min volume of 2000
- float <20000000

*Reversal Scanner:*
- $15-$250
- Volume >500000
- Relative volume of at least 1
- 2 min rsi <25
- 4 negative(-4) 5m candles

## Chapter 11
- Aerobic exercise for 30 mins to free mind and make better judgement
- Find gappers, make a list of 4-6 stocks to keep in watch. Note down the important infos related to each stock
- At 9:15 - 9:30, prepare buy orders for gap and go candidates
- Make 10 trades per day
- Track the trades in a spread sheet. Use it to analyse accuracy rate, average winners/losers of each strategy
- Follow a max day loss
