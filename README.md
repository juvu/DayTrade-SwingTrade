3. Sell the shares once the candlestick closes below the EMA by a threshold or if the stock moves very far away from the EMA, then sell half of the position, then buy in again once it bounces off the EMA line again

### VWAP Trading
Institutional traders who can not buy in all at once due to a large number of shares will buy near the VWAP to ensure they are getting good deals, this is a good set up for buying VWAP bounces.
