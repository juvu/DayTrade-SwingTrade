### Moving Average Trend Trading

1. Watch stock in play, see if in the previous day the stock trend is established around moving average
2. Buy in after confirming the bounce on the EMA line
3. Sell the shares once the candlestick closes below the EMA by a threshold or if the stock moves very far away from the EMA, then sell half of the position, then buy in again once it bounces off the EMA line again
---
### VWAP Trading
Institutional traders who can not buy in all at once due to a large number of shares will buy near the VWAP to ensure they are getting good deals, this is a good set up for buying VWAP bounces.
1. Monitor the watchlist for the day during stock opening, wait and verify that the prices reacts to the VWAP.
2. Buy near the VWAP support, stop loss when close break below the VWAP in a 5 minute candle
3. Sell half of the position at major price levels, and move up the break even point.

### Support and Resistance Trading
Major price level can become support/resistance levels, prices usually have more tendency to react to those price levels.
#### Major price levels
> * Sometimes indecision candles can confirm major price level
> * Whole or half dollars in low float penny stocks can act as support or resistance price levels.
> * Recent data usually are more important.
> * The more lines reacting to a price level, the more important it is.
> * Only price ranges that are close to the current price are important, it's unlikely for prices to ?change to a price region far away.
> *  Sup/res are usually an area, not a price point, be conservative.
> * Only prices that show a clear sup/res and stand out to you are important.
> * Price levels can be drawn on the wick edge of a longer timeframe in a candlestick, where as for swing trading, the more bars it cross the better.
#### How to Trade Major Price Levels
1. Look at the watchlist of the day, find areas with major price levels.
2. If an indecision candle forms around a major price point in a 5 minute chart, buy it as close to the price level as possible. Set a stop loss tightly under the price level.
3. Keep profit near next price level or when it consolidates.
4. Sell half of the position on the way up and move the stop loss up for a break even.
