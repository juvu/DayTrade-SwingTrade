		if wait_for_target(x2):
			sell(1/4)

ABCD:

	4. Sell the rest at price target or when price buyer starting to lose strength

Reversal Trading:
	- Hedge fund or institutional trader started selling large shares to the market
	- Catalyst/Bad news
	Entry requirement:
		- At least 5 5m consecutive candles
		- RSI <10 or >90
		- Idealy at major sup/res
		- Ideally there's a indicision candle(Spinning Top/)
		- at low of day
		- First 5m candle making a new high
		- High volume
	Exit indicators:
		- Stop loss at low of day or previous candle's low
		- Next level of support, vwap, MovAvgs
		- New 5m low

MovAvg Trend:
	1. See if stock is reacting well with MovAvgs
	2. Buy close to MovAvg, set a stop loss just below the MovAvg
	Exit indicators:
		- Exit with all shares when a candle closes below the MovAvg or stopped out below MovAvg
		- Take profit some when price is far off from MovAvg, buy back when it's close to the MovAvg.

VWAP Strategy:
	1. See if price reacts well with VWAP 
	2. Buy close to VWAP to reduce risk
	Exit indicators:
		- Exit with all shares when a candle closes below the VWAP or stopped out just a bit below VWAP
		- Sell 1/2 pos at major sup/res with stop loss adjusted to break even


Sup/Res:
	- May see indecisive candles
	- Half and Whole dollars act as sup/res
	- Recent data are more relevant
	- The more times it's being tested, the stronger it is
	- The more extreme, the stronger it is
	- Wicks for candlesticks in a longer duration candle can be sup/res in a smaller duration(i.e. end of wick of 15m candle can be sup in 1m candles)
	1. In pre-market, layout all the sup/res
	2. If there's a 5m indecision candle at major sup/res, buy close to that area with a stop loss below it
	3. Take part profit at next sup/res, move stop loss to break even
	4. Take all profit at the next sup/res

Opening Range Breakout:
	1. Monitor list of stocks in play for the day. Keep note of the volume, and ensure the shares being traded are diverse.
	2. The opening range should have a relatively low ATR
	3. After 5m candle closed, and new candle has a breakout, this is a desired entry
	4. Stop loss at VWAP
	5. Profit target at sup/res, MovAvg, previous close or 5m low

Red to Green:
	1. Check previous day's close, if the stock heads to previous day's close with high volume, that's a potental profit target
	2. Place stop loss at nearest sup/res or indicator
	3. Take all profit when hit previous close. If it broke out of previous close then sell portion of the position, and adjust stop loss to break even.

Strategies and time of day
	- BullFlag and VWAP is suitable from 9:30-11:00
	- Reversal, VWAP, MovAvg, Sup/Res in mid day
	- VWAP, Sup/Res, MovAvg for close
