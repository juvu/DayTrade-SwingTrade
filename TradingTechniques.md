## Tips
* Afternoon breakout is not as strong as morning spike
* Sell into strength, buy dips
* Double support/resistance is hard to break
* Be careful not going long on a stock after 2:30 as traders tend to take profit
* With a small account, it's better to go long as it has better risk reward. 
*  With a big account(30,000) is better to go short as it's  safer and better winning percentage, but with less reward.
* If the chart has heaviest volume, treat it as a fresh chart
* Watch list - Top percentage gainer
* Don't over trade, and don't break the risk level
* Don't trade with float < 2M as it can be easily manipulated
* Control FOMO, set max loss and step away if it doesn't work out constantly

	* 1/2 at major resistance(most consolidation area) if it spikes
	* Cover half of the morning spike or major support
