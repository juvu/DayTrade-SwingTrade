## Tips
* Afternoon breakout is not as strong as morning spike
* Always take profit into strength, not weakness
* Double support/resistance is hard to break
* Be careful not going long on a stock after 2:30 as traders tend to take profit
* With a small account, it's better to go long as it has better risk reward. Where a big account(30,000) is better to go short as it's  safer and better winning percentage, but with less reward.
* If the chart has heaviest volume in history(couple of years, 2-3?) treat it as a fresh chart
