## Strategy 1 - Promotion

* **Goal is to identify promoter with good promotion history**
* SpeedTrader is good for getting orders filled
* Process
	* Google/Yahoo "Hot Penny Stocks", "Penny Stock Picks" etc..
	* Advertised sites are more effective in general
	* Repeat every few weeks
* StockPromoters.com
	* Go through news letters, and sign up for them
* Promotors
	* StockTips
	* ThePUMPTracker from twitter
* Identify good promotors
	* Look at the correlation between stock volume and promotion
	* Need to see spike in volume in millions
	* If the stock is being promoted for multiple days, if it is, how strong are the prices holding
* Once a good promotor is identified, we need to identify the domains the stock promotors are using to ensure we sign up for all of them in order get the information the fastest
	* From gmail, identify promotors promoting the same ticker at similar times
	* Go on yougetsignal.com
	* Use Reverse IP Domain Check
	* Find other stock promotor sites on the same server
	* Even when a domain is listed already, we still want to check using reverse IP Domain check since it may got moved to a different server
	* Change the ip slightly to see if there are promotors using similar ip(i.e. from 198.27.66.153 to 198.27.66.154)
	* They are essentially from the same stock promoter
	* Once finished, use ThePUMPTracker to see if the same ticker is promoted there, add it to the news letter and keep track to see if they belong to the same group
	* Go to each of the websites, find unique slogans/testimonial(reviews)  to search using "..." to find websites from the same promoter
* Make multiple email and link them to the same account to ensure the promotions will reach the email the fastest
* **Strategy Overview**
* Get in, get out, move on
* Remember how good day one of the promotion was last time, and how good was the overall promotion
* Would used to buy ASAP, using hotkeys and multiple routes until promoters announce them overnight
* The new method is to buy in premarket when the stock is trading at large volume
