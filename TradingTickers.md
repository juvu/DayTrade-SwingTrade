## Strategy 1 - Stock Promotion

* **Goal is to identify promoter with good promotion history**
* SpeedTrader is good for getting orders filled
* Process
	* Google/Yahoo "Hot Penny Stocks", "Penny Stock Picks" etc..
	* Advertised sites are more effective in general
	* Repeat every few weeks
* StockPromoters.com
	* Go through news letters, and sign up for them
* Promotors
	* StockTips
	* ThePUMPTracker from twitter
* Identify good promotors
	* Look at the correlation between stock volume and promotion
	* Need to see spike in volume in millions
	* If the stock is being promoted for multiple days, if it is, how strong are the prices holding
* Once a good promotor is identified, we need to identify the domains the stock promotors are using to ensure we sign up for all of them in order get the information the fastest
	* From gmail, identify promotors promoting the same ticker at similar times
	* Go on yougetsignal.com
	* Use Reverse IP Domain Check
	* Find other stock promotor sites on the same server
	* Even when a domain is listed already, we still want to check using reverse IP Domain check since it may got moved to a different server
	* Change the ip slightly to see if there are promotors using similar ip(i.e. from 198.27.66.153 to 198.27.66.154)
	* They are essentially from the same stock promoter
	* Once finished, use ThePUMPTracker to see if the same ticker is promoted there, add it to the news letter and keep track to see if they belong to the same group
	* Go to each of the websites, find unique slogans/testimonial(reviews)  to search using "..." to find websites from the same promoter
* Make multiple email and link them to the same account to ensure the promotions will reach the email the fastest
* **Strategy Overview**
* Get in, get out, move on
* Remember how good day one of the promotion was last time, and how good was the overall promotion
* When do the promotions get announced?
	* Used to get announced randomly in the mail
		* Would buy ASAP, using hotkeys and multiple routes when there's newsletters
	* Now most major promoters announce them overnight
		* Trade them if there's good volume over premarket
		* Need to be careful as they usually gap up get may be overbought
	* Some would get announce at the opening bell, if they gap up with no news it would pop up in the scanner
		* Can sometimes be spotted if OTC being traded in large volume for no reason, then it would likely pop up in scanner
* **Entrance and Exit**
* Before the opening bell,  price may get knock back down momentarily due to manipulation.
* When the volume is big, with change of direction, it's indicating a support. Try to get in as close as possible in the premarket around the support, as close as possible to market open
* Premarket high could be a resistance
* Watch level 2 and T& S closely  
* Try to sell when it's still strong, once it's weak it gets very hard to sell
* Sell half of the shares when it hits first resistance
* One of the potential risk level is red-green(below previous close) level
* Test different market makers to see which one is more efficient

## Strategy 2 - Buying OTC Multi-day Breakouts

* Need to have good volume & volatility
* Want at least 1 red day in between
* No major resistance levels nearby
* Usually sell a portion as it goes up when it looks like it's about to turn
* The pullback can go below key breakout level by a little bit as it doesn't hold very well, don't rush to sell
*  If holding overnight, risk green red(below previous close) then key support levels as it forms
* Go small overnight in OTC
* When breaking out, level 2 isn't important as it consolidates a lot or when it's not volatile enough
* When betting overnight, use level 2 the next morning
* At EOD, if the stock holding above key levels, may consider holding it overnight
* If a breakout held all day, and in the EOD there started to be some action going towards upside, consider buying in for overnight or sell before closing
* Be careful of overnight halts
* Risk previous support, not breakout levels
* Don't chase spikes, buy dips if I miss
* If the price is overextended, it's better to miss than to buy
* On day 2
	* Use level 2
	* Sell into strength
	* Re-buy with big dip with green red(below previous close) as risk
	* Adjust risk on key support accordingly

## Strategy 3 - OTC Short Setups(FRD)

* Look for overextension for daily graph
* Multiple green days
* Large % run relative to prior action
* First red day or hitting major resistance level
* If it's a pump, then it's better. Look at past promoter history.
* Look at historical graph if it's not a stock promotion
* Use prior resistance as risk
* OTC's can crash fast
* Look at previous days, if the close of the (n-1)<sup>ith</sup> day is below low of n<sup>ith</sup> day, they it's considered as a green day. Once the low of the n<sup>ith</sup> day is below the close of a multi-day runner, then it's a clear momentum shift.
* Sometimes the first red day would not play out nicely for a few consecutive days in a row. In those cases see if first red day holds below previous close for a whole day on the intraday chart
* First red day usually has a dip buy opportunity
* Use red green as risk, can short into bounce
* Sometimes there's a bounce, and we can short the stock the second time during the day
* Be careful about the risk level
* Strategy
	* Short into strength
	* G/R breakdown
	* Bounces

## Strategy 4 - Listed stock breakouts
* Resistance with no volume at those days does not matter as much
* Need to test breakout level at least 2 times
* Ideal chart is when a stock has burst in volume and a big run, then consolidates for a few days and then breaks out
* Don't need to chase, buy dips if missed since charts will be choppy
* Risk previous support, not breakout level
* Daily chart
	* BIG volume compared to the past
	* High volatility
	* Similar to OTC breakouts
		* Major resistance level held for more than 2 days
		* No major overhead resistance
* Intraday
	* Intraday high that matches daily breakout will give more strength
	* Can use consolidation level as risk if buying at the EOD
	* Will buy any time of the day
	* Will buy at pullback
	* Risk prior intraday support and adjust accordingly
	* Sell into strength
	* Use green red
	* Adjust support level along the way

## Strategy 5 - Short First Hard Pullbacks
* Top percent gainer, overextended
* Not easy, must respect risk
* Risk high of day
* Look for lower high after a potential topping out
* Look for the first *hard* pull back
* Above average volume
* Large run from previous consolidation area
* Day 2 or beyond would be ideal

## Strategy 6 - Short Major Resistance on Daily Chart
* Scale in short risking off resistance area
* Cover into fade
* Must have volume (very liquid)
* Risk off day's high
* Can not be too close too the resistance level
* First time testing major resistance level, it'd likely not break
* When it breakouts out, don't panic, see if the breakout would hold
